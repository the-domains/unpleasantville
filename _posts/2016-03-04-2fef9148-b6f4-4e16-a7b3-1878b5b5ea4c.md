Introducing Unpleasantville - tunes loops noise for the discerning punter (that's you!)

1 2 1 2, testing testing.  OK.  Hello.  We're a 21st Century Record Label (whatever that means anymore) .  We live in London (although digitally that don't matter no more), we specialise in musical stuff we like and we're hoping you won't hate.
